# PDFMerger by Rohit

It recursively searches for PDF files in a specified root folder and its subfolders, then combines all the found PDFs into a single PDF file. This program utilizes the iTextSharp library for PDF manipulation. Before running the program, make sure to install the iTextSharp library via NuGet.

Replace "C:\rootfolder" with the path to your desired root folder where you want to search for PDFs. When you run this program, it will create a new folder named "MergedPDFs" in the root folder and save the merged PDF file named "MergedPDF.pdf" inside it.
